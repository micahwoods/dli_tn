The data in the tn_2015.csv file as of 20 December 2015 were obtained from a search of Memphis, Chattanooga, Nashville, and Knoxville from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/ and then manual selection of the airports. Knoxville has fewer records, so for the cumulative sum of growth index I selected only those dates that matched Knoxville, to avoid bias from different number of days included in the sum.

Data in the `starkville_201306_to_201409.csv` file were downloaded from CDO on 20160628.
